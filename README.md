# hello-world
My ideas, resources, and anything else I may need.
I have no major prior experience with coding.  I'm the administrative manager at my job, where we mostly outsource our IT work.  However, when I took the management position, I also started doing as much of the small fixes in house and picking up more and more as I go.  We also use SQL, so I've been trying to learn that.  The more I learn, the more I want to know.  I've always been good with technology, and I'm enjoying digging more into the guts of it.
